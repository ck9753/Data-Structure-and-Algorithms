Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2  story-step1.o story-step2.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Line_1_did_not_match
Your file did not match the expected ouput
Now running YOUR tests for step 1

1.1: Current test is story-step1 story.txt
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

€‰ªyV  €ŠªyV time, there was a cat who lived in a very cat	      |	Once upon a time, there was a cat who lived in a very cat
 cat. 								cat. 
 							      (Your file did not match the expected ouput


1.2: Current test is story-step1 exstory.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind reported errors
Valgrind reported errors or memory leaks:

1.3: Current test is story-step1 exstory2.txt
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

xY¾ÿU xY¾ÿU a time, there was a cat and cat And cat cat 	      \	Once upon a time, there was a cat and cat.
							      >	And cat cat.
Your file did not match the expected ouput


Step 2
Checking that story-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1 story-step2  story-step1.o story-step2.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step2.c
gcc -o story-step2 story-step2.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step2.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step2 exists (good)
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
