Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1  story-step1.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Line_1_did_not_match
Line_2_did_not_match
Your file did not match the expected ouput
Now running YOUR tests for step 1

1.1: Current test is story-step1 story.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
timeout: the monitored command dumped core
But we did not.

1.2: Current test is story-step1 exstory.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
timeout: the monitored command dumped core
But we did not.

1.3: Current test is story-step1 exstory2.txt
-----------------------------
You considered this a failure case:
timeout: the monitored command dumped core
But we did not.

Step 2
Checking that story-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step1  story-step1.o rand_story.o
The code did not compile!
