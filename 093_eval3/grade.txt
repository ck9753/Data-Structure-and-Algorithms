Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3  %(PROGS).o page.o storyBook.o
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o page.o storyBook.o
rm cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3  %(PROGS).o page.o storyBook.o
make: 'cyoa-step2' is up to date.

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3  %(PROGS).o page.o storyBook.o
make: 'cyoa-step3' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------


3.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

0(0),1(1),3(0),8(win)					      |	0(1),1(2),3(1),8(win)
0(0),1(2),4(1),12(win)					      |	0(1),1(3),4(2),12(win)
Your file did not match the expected output



3.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
It looks like you got different output from us on that case.
Here is the diff (yours on left, ours on right):

0(0),1(1),5(0),6(0),8(0),11(win)			      |	0(1),1(2),5(1),6(1),8(1),11(win)
0(0),1(1),5(1),7(0),10(win)				      |	0(1),1(2),5(2),7(1),10(win)
0(1),2(win)						      |	0(2),2(win)
Your file did not match the expected output

No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3  %(PROGS).o page.o storyBook.o
The code did not compile!
