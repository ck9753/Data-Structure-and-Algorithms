Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3  %(PROGS).o page.o storyBook.o
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o page.o storyBook.o
rm cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3  %(PROGS).o page.o storyBook.o
make: 'cyoa-step2' is up to date.

------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------


3.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


3.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


3.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step3 story3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
We considered this a failure case.
But you did not (exit status was EXIT_SUCCESS).
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3  %(PROGS).o page.o storyBook.o
The code did not compile!
